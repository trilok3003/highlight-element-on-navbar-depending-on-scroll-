      Idioms are a wonderful part of the English language that give it a lot of
      flavor. They force people to know more than the literal meaning of words.
      Idioms are commonly used phrases which have a meaning completely different
      than their literal meaning. This can be quite confusing to those who
      aren't familiar with the idiom and those who are studying English.

      a second language because it gives the literal meaning of each phrase.

      number of random idioms which best suits your learning needs is a
      advantage this tool has over standard phrase list. In this way, this tool
      provides an excellent way for those learning English to practice their
      knowledge of English idioms and to learn new ones in the process.

      It can also be a wonderful way for writers to brainstorm and spur more
      creativity in their writing. The tool can be used to get writing ideas
      flowing forcing the writer to use more creativity than they would with a
      single random word. For example, the writer can use the generated phrase
      to create a new paragraph or story. Since the writer has no idea what will
      appear, or even if they will be familiar with the idiom, it forces the
      writer to use creativity to incorporate it into what they're writing.
